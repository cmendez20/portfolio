  <p class="mb-6">I'm currently a computer science major at Western Governors University. I have a passion for coding, learning, and building. Beyond tech, you'll find me enjoing indie films at the theater, cafÃ© hopping, or learning chess.</p>

   <p class="mb-6">I still have much more to learn, and I'm always open to exploring new opportunities, <span class="font-bold">connect with me here.</span></p>
